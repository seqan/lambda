Description: Lambda is a biological sequence aligner for searches
in protein, nucleotide or bisulfite-treated databases. It is highly
compatible to BLAST (bitscore and e-value statistics, tab separated and
verbose output formats), much faster than BLAST and many other comparable
tools and supports many other input and output formats, including
standards-conforming .sam and .bam and many compression types.
